    "\n",
    "The library is built upon the SciPy (Scientific Python) that must be installed before you can use scikit-learn. This stack that includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- NumPy: Base n-dimensional array package\n",
    "- SciPy: Fundamental library for scientific computing\n",
    "- Matplotlib: Comprehensive 2D/3D plotting\n",

    "Although the interface is Python, c-libraries are leverage for performance such as numpy for arrays and matrix operations, [LAPACK](http://www.netlib.org/lapack/), [LibSVM](http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/) and the careful use of cython.\n",
